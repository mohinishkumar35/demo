    The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a
    web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as
    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. <br><br>

    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia
    web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
